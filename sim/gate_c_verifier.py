"""
Gate C — the REAL verifier for the coding-agent showcase.

Loads coding problems from OpenAI's HumanEval dataset (released under the MIT License, copyright OpenAI)
and runs model-generated code against their actual unit tests in an isolated subprocess with a timeout.
Returns 1.0 (all asserts pass) or 0.0 — this is the objective, execution-based feedback signal `s_gt`
that replaces Gate A's synthetic keyword matcher.

NOTE: this executes generated code. A subprocess + timeout is the standard HumanEval
approach and is fine for a local demo, but production should sandbox in a container.
